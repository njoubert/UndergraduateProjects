# UndergraduateProjects

Welcome!

This is an ARCHIVE of most of my projects as an undergraduate EECS student at the University of California, Berkeley. Also included is my Stanford CS147 "Intro to HCI" project - "Burble".

This used to be a Subversion repository on njoubert.com (remember when we had to run our own version control servers??). Now it's a huge github repository!

DISCLAIMER: Much of the code here was written for class assignments. THIS IS PROVIDED HERE PURELY AS DEMONSTRATIONS FOR HOW ONE MIGHT IMPLEMENT IDEAS! I AM NOT LIABLE FOR YOU USE THIS CODE IN ANY DUBIOUS OR FROWNED-UPON MANNER! 

## Highlights:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|[Burble](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/Burble/trunk) and [BurbleServer](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/BurbleServer/trunk)  | An iPhone app to share location and texting. It's like GroupMe + locations before GroupMe was a thing (ugh, bitter much?) |
|[RSCH_ClothSym](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/RSCH_ClothSym/trunk) | A from-scratch cloth simulator written by myself and Sebastian Burke under Prof. James O'Brian as part of an unpublished research project. Includes a useful [paper repository](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/RSCH_ClothSym/trunk/papers)!|
|[Processing Projects](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/Processing/trunk) | All the [Processing.org](https://processing.org/) visualizations I've done, including an [Inverse Kinematics solver](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/Processing/trunk/IK1) and [Fractal Mountain Generator](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/Processing/trunk/FractalMtn1) |
|[Rockband Vision](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/CS184_rockband/trunk) | [Video Demo.](https://vimeo.com/1045326) A robotic rock-band player: runs a computer vision algorithm on a video feed from a camera looking at RockBand on a television set, and actuates the buttons on the rockband guitar. A final project for CS184 (Graphis) |
|[CS184 AS3: Shader](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/CS184_as3/trunk)|This program implements a shader using the Phong Illumination Model. |
|[CS184 AS4: Ray Tracer](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/CS184_as4)|A from-scratch stand-alone Raytracer implementation for CS184 at UC Berkeley|
|[CS184 AS5: Parametric Surfaces](https://github.com/njoubert/UndergraduateProjects/tree/master/CS184_as5/trunk)| Converts a Bezier Surface representation to a polygon representation and display with OpenGL |
