We propose a concurrent relaxed balance AVL tree algorithm that is
fast, scales well, and tolerates contention.  It is based on optimistic
techniques adapted from software transactional memory,
but takes advantage of specific knowledge of the the algorithm to reduce
overheads and avoid unnecessary retries.  We extend our algorithm with
a fast linearizable clone operation, which can be used for
consistent iteration of the tree.
Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm outperforms a highly
tuned concurrent skip list for many access patterns, with an average of
39\% higher single-threaded throughput and 32\% higher multi-threaded
throughput over a range of contention levels and operation mixes.
