Transactional Coherence and Consistency (TCC) is a novel coherence
scheme for shared memory multiprocessors that uses programmer-defined
transactions as the fundamental unit of parallel work, communication,
and coherence. TCC has the potential to simplify parallel program
development and optimization by providing a smooth transition from
sequential to parallel programs. Preliminary results have shown that
TCC systems can achieve good performance but could require substantial
amounts of inter-processor communication bandwidth.

In this paper, we characterize the performance of TCC in comparison to
conventional snoopy cache coherence (SCC) using a detailed model for a
CMP system and parallel applications optimized for each scheme. We
conclude that the two coherence schemes perform similarly across a
wide range of architectural parameters, with each scheme having a
slight advantage for some applications. The bandwidth requirements of
TCC are slightly higher than those of SCC but well within the
capabilities of CMP systems. Our results suggest that TCC can provide
its programming advantages without compromising the performance
expected from well tuned shared memory multiprocessor applications.
