<h3> 14.2.2. Homework </h3>


<ol>
<li> Exercise 12.1 from <cite>Data Structures Into Java</cite>.  However,
     the template is in <code><a href="code/hw9/Chase.java">~cs61b/code/hw9/Chase.java</a></code>, rather than
     what the problem says.


<li> Fill in the implementation of the union-find class in 
	<code><a href="code/hw9/UnionFind.java">~cs61b/code/hw9/UnionFind.java</a></code>.

<li> In the standard Unix <code>make</code> program, the notation
<pre>
<var>F0</var> : <var>F1</var> <var>F2</var> &hellip;

</pre>
means both "to create <var>F0</var>, you must first create or have
available <var>F1</var>, <var>F2</var>, &hellip;" and also
"whenever you change any of <var>F1</var>, <var>F2</var>, &hellip;, you
must then modify <var>F0</var>."  Each of the <var>Fi</var> is a string
of non-blank characters, not including colon.
Fill in the template

<code><a href="code/hw9/Make.java">~cs61b/code/hw9/Make.java</a></code> to read a number of lines in 
this format and then to generate a list of lines of the form
<pre>
Generate <var>Fi</var>
</pre>
that will create all the <var>Fi</var> that appear to the left of a
colon in the input in such an order as to obey the rules in the input.  
If this is impossible (due to circular rules), print just 
<pre>
Circularity detected.
</pre> 
instead.

<li> [Misha Dynin, from a contest in St. Petersburg, Russia]
Given a rectangle of letters (such as

<pre>
    AB
    BC
</pre>
), a starting position within that rectangle (such as the character in the
upper-left corner), and a string  (such as "ABBC"), consider the
question of finding paths through the letters that match
the given string, begin at the starting
position, and at each step move one square in one  of the eight compass
directions (north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast,
southwest).  For the given example, there are two such paths. They are
(<code>E-SW-E</code>) and (<code>S-NE-S</code>)&mdash;that is, 
"one step east, one step
southwest, one step east" and "one step south, one step northeast,
and one step south."  For the rectangle
<pre>
    CBB
    BBA
</pre>
and the string "BBCBBA", starting at the square in the middle of the
top row, there are 12 paths.  Paths are allowed to visit the same
position twice.

<p>
Using the template in <code><a href="code/hw9/CountPaths.java">~cs61b/code/hw9/CountPaths.java</a></code>,
you are to write a program that, given such a rectangle, string, and
starting position, reports the <em>number</em> of distinct paths that
match the string, according to the definitions above.  The input (on 
the standard input) will
consist of four positive integers (call them <var>M</var>,

<var>N</var>, <var>r</var>, and <var>c</var>), a string
(<var>S</var>), and <var>M</var> strings consisting of upper-case
letters A&ndash;Z, each of which is <var>N</var> characters long.
These inputs are all separated from each other by whitespace. The
<var>M</var> strings are the rows of the rectangle, from top to
bottom.  The pair <var>(r,c)</var> are the coordinates of the starting
position, with <var>0&lt;= r &lt; M</var>, <var>0 &lt;= c&lt;N</var>.  Row 0 is
the top row; column 0 is the left column.  The output will be a line
reporting the number of paths in the format shown in the examples.


<p>
You may assume that the number of paths is less than <var>2<sup>63</sup></var>,
<var>M&lt;=80</var>, <var>N&lt;=80</var>.  Nevertheless, be aware that the time limit is 
less than a minute.
