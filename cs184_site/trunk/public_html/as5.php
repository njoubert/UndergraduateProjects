<h2>Assignment 5</h2>

<p><h3>Drawing Bezier Curves</h3>
<br>To get a feel for Bezier curves, I put together a little Processing app that draws Bezier curves. Drag the control points around to change the shape of the curve. Feel free to check out the source code.

<p><h3>Calculating Bezier Surface points</h3>
<br>Since I could now calculate points on a curve, it was a logical step to attempt finding points on a surface. This example draws the Teapot example surface in a point-based rendering methodology by finding points on surfaces and plotting them. This is purely to experiment with reading in the bez file, and calculating points (and derivates) across the surface.
