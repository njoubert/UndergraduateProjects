                                This is my portfolio, demonstrating research I've been involved in and projects I've worked on. My major fields of interest are computer graphics and human computer interaction, and I've conducted research on physically based simulations and online video interaction. My minor concentrations are large-scale system design and astrophysics, both as a compliment to my graphics interest. My research interests is accompanied by a passion for teaching computer science, and I'm a member of the teaching staff at UC Berkeley.

                        I'm working on improving simulation quality and efficiency in multiplayer game environments. To that end, I've built a real-time cloth simulator and am working on synchronizing simulations between clients and servers to improve simulation quality.

							Rockband Vision is a computer vision system capable of playing the Rockband console game
							autonomously by monitoring the game's display through a camera pointed at a television connected to the console. 
							Rockband is an interactive band simulator that allows human players to play music
							according to on-screen musical notation. Our system is capable
							of interpreting the Rockband video feed presented to human players - it reads the musical
							notation in the feed and manipulate the game's input to play the game. Since it monitors the screen through a video camera, the system is capable of playing alongside human players to form a 4-person band with some instruments played by people, some by our vision system. This project relied on a
							breadth of knowledge from the computer graphics, numerical analysis and physical computing
							areas, and was built on top of the <a href="http://opencvlibrary.sourceforge.net/">OpenCV</a> framework. We presented it as our final project for Berkeley's Computer Graphics course.

                            This project served as an exploration of curved surface rendering. Input files describing Bezier patches are interpolated using DeCasteljau evaluation into a cloud of points, grouped into triangles, and tessellated further until a measure of flatness is satisfied. More details can be found on my <a href="assets/cs184/site/index.php?page=as5">class webpage</a>. Prototypes were used to aid designing of this project. Rapid prototyping was employed to expanded my understanding of the concepts of splines, and provide rapid feedback of my design. You can access them as Java applets here:

                            Data structures play a crucial role in Computer Graphics. I implemented a Quadtree structure to store points in 2D space, allowing simulation of collisions in a collection on the order of 10 000 points. A default environment is populated with a random distribution of particles, each with a random velocity vector. The simulation optimizes itself by calculating the next point in time at which two particles will collide, and moving the simulation of the environment to that point. Collisions are fully elastic and calculated using a non-deterministic physics engine.

                            I interned at <a href="http://www.yahooresearchberkeley.com/">Yahoo! Research Berkeley</a>
                            for the duration of 2007. I was a member of the Media and Community team, responsible for the back-end Flash video server, as well as synchronous video sharing applications built on top of the platform I developed. The video server platform was based around the Red5 video server, and our prototypes, codenamed Zync and Webzync, went on to be intergrated into Yahoo! Messenger and Yahoo! Live.

                            Going to movies in a group and inviting friends over to watch TV are common social activities. This social engagement both improves the viewing experience and helps us stay close with our friends and family. To bring this feeling of co-presence to the Internet, we developed a set of prototypes that enable people to feel more connected by watching web video together in sync. We present the preliminary results of a quantitative usage study and show initial evidence that simultaneous video sharing online can help people feel closer and more connected to their friends and family.

                            is the first incarnation of our video sharing concept. Zync comes in the form of a Yahoo! Messenger plugin that can play online video. By dropping a video into Zync, the two participants in the conversation sees a synchronized stream of video between both parties - in other words, each person received the same frame of video at the same point in time. This mimics the behaviour of having several people watching the same television - if one participant decides to, for example, skip ahead in the video, all participants are involved.

                            (non-public) used the platform provided by my modified version of Red5 to recreate the Zync experience as a many-to-many online chat interface. Multiple people can join a room, watch video clips (either through posted content or by streaming video from other online providers) and control the viewing experience. We worked in conjunction with the Yahoo! Live team, and we cross-polinated project ideas. Some of the concepts I mention can now be found implemented on the <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live site</a>.

                            When I joined the research team, they were using a slightly modified HTTP server to progressively download video to the client. I started working on the Red5 Open Source Flash video server as an alternative to the in-house server. Red5 had serious limitations - seeking was slow and used excessive disk space, audio support was minimal, and there was no abstraction between files on disk and video streams. I solved each of these issues and Red5 became the prime platform for the <a href="http://www.yahooresearchberkeley.com/">research lab</a>'s video prototypes.

                            My first forage into short films focused on my love of extreme sports. I find that the human drive to challenge Nature creates a most facinating scene for exploration through the medium of film.

                            The SYO is the premier orchestra for high school students in South Africa. I was one of a 3 member team that filmed and authored 5 DVDs featuring their live performances. This included live audio and video capture, non-linear editing and DVD authoring. The final DVD was used as a successful application to the Vancouver Youth Orchestra's conductor position.

                            I am a member of the research team led Professor Alex Filippenko responsible for the most discoveries of new supernovae in nearby galaxies each year. I am a certified observer, and have used the Nickel 1m telescope at Lick Observatory, on top of Mt. Hamilton extensively for Supernovae photometry follow-ups.

                        Much of astrophysics consists of signal processing and simulation problems, and can serve as a rich body of work to motivate and enrich computer simulations. Berkeley's Radioastronomy course depends on the student's ability to model and simulate the solar system for tracking purposes, and apply engineering principles to measure physical parameters of objects in our galaxy. Here I present 4 papers my team authored during our radioastronomy class.

                            We present a report on studying the sun, the moon and the Crab Nebula using the technique known as interferometry. We present an exhaustive discussion on radio interferometry theory, followed by a discussion of using interferometry to measure accurate declinations of point sources and accurate angular diameters of extended sources using non-linear least squares techniques.

                            We attempted to use natural hydrogen emission to map a high velocity cloud falling into our
                            galaxy. We spent approximately 62 hours observing a hydrogen cloud with peak signals of 2 Kelvin, forcing us to use several procedures to minimize noise and tease out our signal from the background radiation and equipment noise. Gaussian fitting and Fourier filtering accompanied by spectrum calibration allowed us to generate a map of this fast-moving hydrogen cloud:                            <br/>
