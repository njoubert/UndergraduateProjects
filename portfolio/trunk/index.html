                                This is my portfolio, demonstrating my work. My expertise lies in back-end system development, thus a significant part of my work is best demonstrated through applications. This portfolio attempts to serve that purpose by providing a gateway to projects I have worked on. Some projects are embedded into this portfolio, others can best be experienced through visiting their respective online locations, requiring an internet connection.

							Rockband Vision is a computer vision system capable of playing the Rockband console game
							autonomously. Rockband is an interactive band simulator that allows human players to play music
							according to on-screen musical notation using custom musical instruments. Our system is capable
							of interpreting the Rockband video feed presented to human players: it is able to read the musical
							notation in the feed and manipulate the game's guitar input to play the game. This project relied on a
							breadth of knowledge from the computer graphics, numerical analysis and physical computing
							areas. We present it as our final project for Berkeley's Computer Graphics course.

                            This project served as an exploration of curved surface rendering. Input files describing Bezier patches are interpolated using DeCasteljau evaluation into a cloud of points, algebraically grouped into triangles, and optionally adaptively tessellated further until a measure of flatness is satisfied.

Through rapid prototyping of the mathematical methods using the Processing language, I shortened my design cycle and expanded my understanding of the implementation challenges presented by a system converting tens of Bezier surface patches into a model containing upwards of 20 000 triangles.

                                I implemented the Phong shading algorithm as a first interaction on a pixel level with OpenGL. The Phong calculation is done over a sphere, and my program calculates the pixel color value over the surface. This served as an excellent entry to using OpenGL as display API and play with implementing shading algorithms that interpret normals, colors and color mixing in various ways.

                            Data structures play a crucial role in Computer Graphics. I implemented a Quadtree structure to store points in 2D space, allowing simulation of collisions in a collection on the order of 10 000 points. A default environment is populated with a random distribution of particles, each with a random velocity vector. The simulation optimizes itself by calculating the next point in time at which two particles will collide, and moving the simulation of the environment to that point. Collisions are fully elastic and calculated using a semi-non-deterministic physics engine.

                            Going to movies in a group and inviting friends over to watch TV are common social activities. This social engagement both improves the viewing experience and helps us stay close with our friends and family. To bring this feeling of co-presence to the Internet, we developed a set of prototypes that enable people to feel more connected by watching web video together in sync. We present the preliminary results of a quantitative usage study and show initial evidence that simultaneous video sharing online can help people feel closer and more connected to their friends and family.

                            is the first incarnation of our video sharing concept. Zync comes in the form of a Yahoo! Messenger plugin that can play online video. By dropping a video into Zync, the two participants in the conversation sees a synchronized stream of video between both parties - in other words, each person received the same frame of video at the same point in time. This mimics the behaviour of having several people watching the same television - if one participant decides to, for example, skip ahead in the video, all participants are involved.

                            (non-public) used the platform provided by my modified version of Red5 to recreate the Zync experience as a many-to-many online chat interface. Multiple people can join a room, watch video clips (either through posted content or by streaming video from other online providers) and control the viewing experience. We worked in conjunction with the Yahoo! Live team, and we cross-polinated project ideas. Some of the concepts I mention can now be found implemented on the <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live site</a>.

                            When I joined the research team, they were using a slightly modified HTTP server to progressively download video to the client. I started working on the Red5 Open Source Flash video server as an alternative to the in-house server. Red5 had serious limitations - seeking was slow and used excessive disk space, audio support was minimal, and there was no abstraction between files on disk and video streams. I solved each of these issues and Red5 became the prime platform for the <a href="http://www.yahooresearchberkeley.com/">research lab</a>'s video prototypes.

                            We present a report on activities concerning radioastronomy bench measurements performed
                            during the first 3 weeks of enrollment in Astronomy 121 at UC Berkeley. We performed several
                            experiments to become acquainted with the equipment and signal processing involved in the Radio
                            Astronomy Lab. This document focuses on four main areas: Fourier transforms, investigating the
                            Nyquist frequency1, investigating Dual Sideband Mixers, and phase detection using mixers. Each
                            area depends heavily and contains information on Discreet Fourier Transforms, IDL programming
                            & organization, and the UNIX operating system. This document strives to be an overview of

                            We present a report on the activities concerning the radioastronomy technique known as interferometry.
                            We first discuss coordinate systems, coordinate system conversions and precession.
                            We prelude our technical findings with an exhaustive discussion on radio interferometry theory,
                            in which we cover interference, point source response, and notes on our technical equipment.
                            The main body of the report consists of using interferometry to measure accurate declinations
                            of point sources and accurate angular diameters of extended sources. We cover both the theory
                            and practice of these two fundamental uses of interferometry. Finally, we present brute force and
                            non-linear least squares techniques. We studied the sun and moon as our extended sources and
                            the Crab Nebula as a point source with UC Berkeley's undergraduate interferometer.

                            We attempted to use natural hydrogen emission to map a high velocity cloud falling into our
                            galaxy at speeds in the region of 120 km/s to 170 km/s. We went to extensive trouble to track
                            and predict our extended object across the sky, and spent approximately 62 hours on observations
                            alone. Our object had peak signals of about 2 Kelvin, forcing us to use several procedures to
                            minimize noise and tease out our signal from the background radiation and equipment noise.
                            We used Gaussian fitting and Fourier filtering along with the spectrum calibration process to
                            successfully reduce all our observations to useful velocity and intensity values, which we put
                            through an interpolation and resizing process to successfully generate color maps of our object.
