== Welcome to BurbleServer

Purpose: Provide the global store for the Burble iPhone app.

Design Principle: Keep everything GENERAL, MINIMAL and OPEN-ENDED. Processing of data should be done client-side!


== Functionality needed:

NOTE: x- indicates completed. - indicates todo.

Bidirectional relationships: Make sure that this works correct!
If special logic is used to set the group of a person, special logic is needed to add people to a group.

=== Person:
A person is someone *using* our app. We do NOT track people's friends lists server side!! That's on the iPhone! 

We need a system for having a list of friends on your phone, and only some of them actually use burble. A person's friends that are users of the app have friendships in the database. A person's friends imported from Facebook, contacts, etc. that have not used the app are not on the server side. 

What is the system to bring a friend into the app? Many people have the same friend, if he comes online how do we make those friendship associations correctly?


x- Create a new person 
x- Set a person's group
x- Set a person's group to null
x- Enforce only one active group when setting a group
x- Get a person's group
x- Keep all Group Memberships around so that you can historically see which groups you were in.

=== Position:
A position logs where a person was at a specific point in time.

x- Create a position associated with a person

=== Group:
A group is a collection of people for some duration of time. A group becomes inactive when it has no active members. The unique ID for a group is (name, created_at). Thus people can rejoin old groups.

x- Create a group
x- See active members of the group
x- See all members of the group
- Add members to a group with the correct logic of their group being updated.

=== Waypoint:
Waypoints are associated with a user that created them and a group that the user was in.
x- Add a new waypoint (with a user and a group)
x- Get the details of a waypoint

=== Message:


=== Invite:
