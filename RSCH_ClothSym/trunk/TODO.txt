Implement Energy-based calculation

Implement better solver


Mesh -> vertices (points) with edges to each other! encode as vertices with edges ptrs and edges array.
	- Support iterating over all vertices
	- Support iterating over all edges
	- Support getting edges for vertex
	- Support arbitrary edges per vertex
	- Support calculating edge length
