TODO
---------

Short Term:
	Better Camera Control (zooming...)
	Auto-Resizing to fit mesh
	Command line K-value inputs
	
Nice to Have:
	Better mouse control
	
Next Major Steps:
	Implicit Integrator
	Jacobians for Bend Forces

Implement in Matlab / Look through Matlab code

Ground Constraint / Arbitrary procedural constraints

Drag force  - air resistance?
