<h1 class="title">Image sequences and atlases</h1>
<p>Sometimes a single image is used to hold several images.  For example, a
&quot;sprite sheet&quot; is an image that contains each animation frame required for a
character sprite animation.</p>
<p>pyglet provides convenience classes for extracting the individual images from
such a composite image as if it were a simple Python sequence.  Discrete
images can also be packed into one or more larger textures with texture bins
and atlases.</p>

<p>An &quot;image grid&quot; is a single image which is divided into several smaller images
by drawing an imaginary grid over it.  The following image shows an image used
for the explosion animation in the <em>Astraea</em> example.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="explosion.png" src="explosion.png" />
<p class="caption">An image consisting of eight animation frames arranged in a grid.</p>
</div>
<p>This image has one row and eight columns.  This is all the information you
need to create an <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.ImageGrid-class.html " title="pyglet.image.ImageGrid">ImageGrid</a> with:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
explosion = pyglet.image.load(<span class="py-string">'explosion.png'</span>)
explosion_seq = pyglet.image.ImageGrid(explosion, 1, 8)</pre>
<p>The images within the grid can now be accessed as if they were their own
images:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
frame_1 = explosion_seq[0]
frame_2 = explosion_seq[1]</pre>
<p>Images with more than one row can be accessed either as a single-dimensional
sequence, or as a (row, column) tuple; as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="image_grid.png" src="image_grid.png" />
<p class="caption">An image grid with several rows and columns, and the slices that can be
used to access it.</p>
</div>
<p>Image sequences can be sliced like any other sequence in Python.  For example,
the following obtains the first four frames in the animation:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
start_frames = explosion_seq[:4]</pre>
<p>For efficient rendering, you should use a <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.TextureGrid-class.html " title="pyglet.image.TextureGrid">TextureGrid</a>.  This uses a single
texture for the grid, and each individual image returned from a slice will be
a <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.TextureRegion-class.html " title="pyglet.image.TextureRegion">TextureRegion</a>:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
explosion_tex_seq = image.TextureGrid(explosion_seq)</pre>
<p>Because <cite>TextureGrid</cite> is also a <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.Texture-class.html " title="pyglet.image.Texture">Texture</a>, you can use it either as individual
images or as the whole grid at once.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id307" id="d-textures" name="d-textures">3D textures</a></h1>
<p><cite>TextureGrid</cite> is extremely efficient for drawing many sprites from a single
texture.  One problem you may encounter, however, is bleeding between adjacent
images.</p>
<p>When OpenGL renders a texture to the screen, by default it obtains each pixel
colour by interpolating nearby texels.  You can disable this behaviour by
switching to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GL_NEAREST</span></tt> interpolation mode, however you then lose the
benefits of smooth scaling, distortion, rotation and sub-pixel positioning.</p>
<p>You can alleviate the problem by always leaving a 1-pixel clear border around
each image frame.  This will not solve the problem if you are using
mipmapping, however.  At this stage you will need a 3D texture.</p>
<p>You can create a 3D texture from any sequence of images, or from an
<cite>ImageGrid</cite>.  The images must all be of the same dimension, however they need
not be powers of two (pyglet takes care of this by returning <cite>TextureRegion</cite>
as with a regular <cite>Texture</cite>).</p>
<p>In the following example, the explosion texture from above is uploaded into a
3D texture:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
explosion_3d = pyglet.image.Texture3D.create_for_image_grid(explosion_seq)</pre>
<p>You could also have stored each image as a separate file and used
<a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.Texture3D-class.html#create_for_images " title="pyglet.image.Texture3D.create_for_images">Texture3D.create_for_images</a> to create the 3D texture.</p>
<p>Once created, a 3D texture behaves like any other <cite>ImageSequence</cite>; slices
return <cite>TextureRegion</cite> for an image plane within the texture.  Unlike a
<cite>TextureGrid</cite>, though, you cannot blit a <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.Texture3D-class.html " title="pyglet.image.Texture3D">Texture3D</a> in its entirety.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id308" id="texture-bins-and-atlases" name="texture-bins-and-atlases">Texture bins and atlases</a></h1>
<p>Image grids are useful when the artist has good tools to construct the larger
images of the appropriate format, and the contained images all have the same
size.  However it is often simpler to keep individual images as separate files
on disk, and only combine them into larger textures at runtime for efficiency.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.atlas.TextureAtlas-class.html " title="pyglet.image.atlas.TextureAtlas">TextureAtlas</a> is initially an empty texture, but images of any size can be
added to it at any time.  The atlas takes care of tracking the &quot;free&quot; areas
within the texture, and of placing images at appropriate locations within the
texture to avoid overlap.</p>
<p>It's possible for a <cite>TextureAtlas</cite> to run out of space for new images, so
applications will need to either know the correct size of the texture to
allocate initally, or maintain multiple atlases as each one fills up.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.image.atlas.TextureBin-class.html " title="pyglet.image.atlas.TextureBin">TextureBin</a> class provides a simple means to manage multiple atlases.
The following example loads a list of images, then inserts those images into a
texture bin.  The resulting list is a list of <cite>TextureRegion</cite> images that map
into the larger shared texture atlases:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
images = [
    pyglet.image.load(<span class="py-string">'img1.png'</span>),
    pyglet.image.load(<span class="py-string">'img2.png'</span>),
    <span class="py-comment"># ...</span>
]

bin = pyglet.image.atlas.TextureBin()
images = [bin.add(image) <span class="py-keyword">for</span> image <span class="py-keyword">in</span> images]</pre>
<p>The <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.resource-module.html ">pyglet.resource</a> module (see <a class="reference sectionlink" href="application_resources.html">Application resources</a>) uses texture bins
internally to efficiently pack images automatically.</p>
