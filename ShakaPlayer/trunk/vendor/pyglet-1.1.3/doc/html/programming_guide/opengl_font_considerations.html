<h1 class="title">OpenGL font considerations</h1>
<p>Text in pyglet is drawn using textured quads.  Each font maintains a set of
one or more textures, into which glyphs are uploaded as they are needed.  For
most applications this detail is transparent and unimportant, however some of
the details of these glyph textures are described below for advanced users.</p>
<div class="section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id297" id="context-affinity" name="context-affinity">Context affinity</a></h1>
<p>When a font is loaded, it immediately creates a texture in the current
context's object space.  Subsequent textures may need to be created if there
is not enough room on the first texture for all the glyphs.  This is done when
the glyph is first requested.</p>
<p>pyglet always assumes that the object space that was active when the font was
loaded is the active one when any texture operations are performed.  Normally
this assumption is valid, as pyglet shares object spaces between all contexts
by default.  There are a few situations in which this will not be the case,
though:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When explicitly setting the context share during context creation.</li>
<li>When multiple display devices are being used which cannot support a shared
context object space.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any of these cases, you will need to reload the font for each object space
that it's needed in.  pyglet keeps a cache of fonts, but does so
per-object-space, so it knows when it can reuse an existing font instance or
if it needs to load it and create new textures.  You will also need to ensure
that an appropriate context is active when any glyphs may need to be added.</p>

<div class="section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id298" id="blend-state" name="blend-state">Blend state</a></h1>
<p>The glyph textures have an internal format of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GL_ALPHA</span></tt>, which provides
a simple way to recolour and blend antialiased text by changing the
vertex colors.  pyglet makes very few assumptions about the OpenGL state, and
will not alter it besides changing the currently bound texture.</p>
<p>The following blend state is used for drawing font glyphs:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
<span class="py-keyword">from</span> pyglet.gl <span class="py-keyword">import</span> *
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
glEnable(GL_BLEND)</pre>
<p>All glyph textures use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GL_TEXTURE_2D</span></tt> target, so you should ensure that
a higher priority target such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GL_TEXTURE_3D</span></tt> is not enabled before
trying to render text.</p>
