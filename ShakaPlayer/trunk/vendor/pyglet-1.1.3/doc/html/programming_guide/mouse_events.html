<h1 class="title">Mouse events</h1>
<p>All mouse events are dispatched by the window which receives the event from
the operating system.  Typically this is the window over which the mouse
cursor is, however mouse exclusivity and drag operations mean this is not
always the case.</p>
<p>The coordinate space for the mouse pointer's location is relative to the
bottom-left corner of the window, with increasing Y values approaching the top
of the screen (note that this is &quot;upside-down&quot; compared with many other
windowing toolkits, but is consistent with the default OpenGL projection in
pyglet).</p>

<p class="caption">The coordinate space for the mouse pointer.</p>
</div>
<p>The most basic mouse event is <cite>on_mouse_motion</cite> which is dispatched every time
the mouse moves:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_motion</span>(x, y, dx, dy):
    <span class="py-keyword">pass</span></pre>
<p>The <cite>x</cite> and <cite>y</cite> parameters give the coordinates of the mouse pointer, relative
to the bottom-left corner of the window.</p>
<p>The event is dispatched every time the operating system registers a mouse
movement.  This is not necessarily once for every pixel moved -- the operating
system typically samples the mouse at a fixed frequency, and it is easy to
move the mouse faster than this.  Conversely, if your application is not
processing events fast enough you may find that several queued-up mouse events
are dispatched in a single <a class="reference apilink" href="../api/pyglet.window.Window-class.html#dispatch_events " title="pyglet.window.Window.dispatch_events">Window.dispatch_events</a> call.  There is no need to
concern yourself with either of these issues; the latter rarely causes
problems, and the former can not be avoided.</p>
<p>Many games are not concerned with the actual position of the mouse cursor, and
only need to know in which direction the mouse has moved.  For example, the
mouse in a first-person game typically controls the direction the player
looks, but the mouse pointer itself is not displayed.</p>
<p>The <cite>dx</cite> and <cite>dy</cite> parameters are for this purpose: they give the distance the
mouse travelled along each axis to get to its present position.  This can be
computed naively by storing the previous <cite>x</cite> and <cite>y</cite> parameters after every
mouse event, but besides being tiresome to code, it does not take into account
the effects of other obscuring windows.  It is best to use the <cite>dx</cite> and <cite>dy</cite>
parameters instead.</p>
<p>The following events are dispatched when a mouse button is pressed or
released, or the mouse is moved while any button is held down:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_press</span>(x, y, button, modifiers):
    <span class="py-keyword">pass</span>

<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_release</span>(x, y, button, modifiers):
    <span class="py-keyword">pass</span>

<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_drag</span>(x, y, dx, dy, buttons, modifiers):
    <span class="py-keyword">pass</span></pre>
<p>The <cite>x</cite>, <cite>y</cite>, <cite>dx</cite> and <cite>dy</cite> parameters are as for the <cite>on_mouse_motion</cite> event.
The press and release events do not require <cite>dx</cite> and <cite>dy</cite> parameters as they
would be zero in this case.  The <a class="reference sectionlink" href="keyboard_events.html#modifiers">modifiers</a> parameter is as for the keyboard
events, see <a class="reference sectionlink" href="working_with_the_keyboard.html">Working with the keyboard</a>.</p>
<p>The <cite>button</cite> parameter signifies which mouse button was pressed, and is one of
the following constants:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
pyglet.window.mouse.LEFT
pyglet.window.mouse.MIDDLE
pyglet.window.mouse.RIGHT</pre>
<p>The <cite>buttons</cite> parameter in <cite>on_mouse_drag</cite> is a bitwise combination of all the
mouse buttons currently held down.  For example, to test if the user is
performing a drag gesture with the left button:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
<span class="py-keyword">from</span> pyglet.window <span class="py-keyword">import</span> mouse

<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_drag</span>(x, y, dx, dy, buttons, modifiers):
    <span class="py-keyword">if</span> buttons &amp; mouse.LEFT:
        <span class="py-keyword">pass</span></pre>
<p>When the user begins a drag operation (i.e., pressing and holding a mouse
button and then moving the mouse), the window in which they began the drag
will continue to receive the <cite>on_mouse_drag</cite> event as long as the button is
held down.  This is true even if the mouse leaves the window.  You generally
do not need to handle this specially: it is a convention among all operating
systems that dragging is a gesture rather than a direct manipulation of the
user interface widget.</p>
<p>There are events for when the mouse enters or leaves a window:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_enter</span>(x, y):
    <span class="py-keyword">pass</span>

<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_leave</span>(x, y):
    <span class="py-keyword">pass</span></pre>
<p>The coordinates for <cite>on_mouse_leave</cite> will lie outside of your window.  These
events are not dispatched while a drag operation is taking place.</p>
<p>The mouse scroll wheel generates the <cite>on_mouse_scroll</cite> event:</p>
<pre class="py-doctest">
<span class="py-keyword">def</span> <span class="py-defname">on_mouse_scroll</span>(x, y, scroll_x, scroll_y):
    <span class="py-keyword">pass</span></pre>
<p>The <cite>scroll_y</cite> parameter gives the number of &quot;clicks&quot; the wheel moved, with
positive numbers indicating the wheel was pushed forward.  The <cite>scroll_x</cite>
parameter is 0 for most mice, however some new mice such as the Apple Mighty
Mouse use a ball instead of a wheel; the <cite>scroll_x</cite> parameter gives the
horizontal movement in this case.  The scale of these numbers is not known; it
is typically set by the user in their operating system preferences.</p>
