<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Now that you are done with implementing an ALU, let's implement a simple 8-bit single cycle CPU. This means, we will have 8-bit instructions and 8-bit byte addressing. As with HW6, you will be using <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/">Logisim</a> to complete this project.
</p>

<hr width=75%>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Copy the contents of ~cs61c/proj/03 to your home directory.
<pre>
   $ mkdir ~/proj
   $ cp -r ~cs61c/proj/03 ~/proj3
</pre>
This will copy in cpu.circ, the Logisim circuit file where you will be implementing your processor, and converter.circ, a file that will help you implement a particular instruction in this project.

<p><hr width=75%>

<h2>Assignment -- Part 1: the ISA</h2>

<p>In <code>cpu.circ</code>, you will be implementing a simple 8-bit processor with four 8-bit data registers. This processor will also have separate instruction and data memories.</p>

<p>Similar to the MIPS ISA presented in lecture, there will be three 
different instruction types: R, I, and J-type. The R-type instruction 
format seen in lecture has 3 fields to specify the source, target, and 
destination registers. Unfortunately, with 8 bits we don't have enough 
bits to specify all the information if we want to maximize functionality. As a result, we will permanently designate two registers to have special functionality -- one always acting as a source ($rs), and the other always acting as the destination ($rd). The remaining two registers  ($r0 and $r1) will behave as normal data registers that you have been accustomed to. Naturally, there will be special instructions to move information between the data registers ($r0 and $r1) and the special registers ($rs and $rd).

<p>The primary instruction encoding is given below. You can determine which instruction a byte encodes by looking at the opcode (bits 5-7). Please note that $rx registers below refer only to registers $r0 and $r1.</p>

<p>You've already built an ALU that should support the first 8 R-type instructions.
Let us now add 6 more instructions. Note that you actually <i>don't</i> have to modify
your ALU in order to implement these new instructions. Try to think of clever ways to
use the ALU in order to get the wanted functionality.<p>


<h3>I-type instructions</h3>

<p>All <tt>immediate</tt> fields are treated as <b><u>unsigned</u></b> numbers and are zero-extended accordingly.</p>

<a name="j_type">
<h3>J-type instructions</h2>

  <h4><tt>jump</tt></h4>

  <p>The <tt>jump</tt> instruction's argument is a pseudoabsolute
  address, just as in MIPS. <tt>address</tt> is an unsigned number
  representing the lower five bits of the next instruction to be
  executed. The upper three bits are taken from the current
  <tt>PC</tt>.</p>
  <pre>
    PC = (PC &amp; 0xe0) | address  </pre>

  <h4><tt>beq</tt></h4>

  <p>The <tt>beq</tt> instruction's argument is a <b><u>signed</u></b>
  offset relative to the next instruction to be executed normally,
  also as in MIPS. <tt>beq</tt> can be represented as the
  following:</p>

  <pre>
    if $r0 == $r1
      PC = PC + 1 + offset
    else
      PC = PC + 1</pre>

<hr width=75%>

<h2>Assignment -- Part 2: Testing</h2>
<p> More to come in a few days. You will need to write a program that uses your processor</p>

<hr width=75%>

<h2>Logisim</h2>

<p>It is strongly recommended that you download and run Logisim
on your local machine while developing your CPU. As you've
probably discovered in lab, Logisim can quickly overwhelm the
instructional machines. Though Logisim is generally stable
compared to earlier semesters, it is still recommended that you
save and backup your .circ files early and often. The official
version of Logisim we will be using for evaluation is v2.1.5.</p>

  <h4>RAM Modules</h4>

  <p>Logisim RAM modules can be found in the built-in memory
  library. To add the library to your project, select "Project/Load
  Library/Built-in Library..." and select the Memory
  module.</p><img src="ram.png" align="center" />

  <p>The best way to learn how these work is simply to play with
  them. In any case, here's a little bit of info to help you get
  started. The Logisim help page on RAM modules can be found
  <a href=
  "http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/docs/2.0.3/libs/mem/ram.html">
  here</a>, but is not terribly helpful. "A" chooses which address
  will be accessed (if any). "sel" essentially determines whether
  or not the RAM module is active (if "sel" is low, "D" is
  undefined). The clock input provides synchronization for memory
  writes. "out" determines whether or not memory is being read or
  written. If "out" is high, then "D" will be driven with the
  contents of memory at address "A". "clr" will instantly set all
  contents of memory to 0 if high. "D" acts as both data in and
  data out for this module. This means that you must use a
  controlled buffer on the input of "D" to prevent conflicts
  between data being driven in and the contents of memory. The
  "poke" tool can be used to modify the contents of the module.</p>

  <p>You will be using a Logisim ROM module for your instruction
  memory. It is a much simplified version of a RAM module Both RAM
  and ROM modules can also be loaded from files using
  "right-click/Load Image..."</p><a name="disp" id="disp"></a>

  <a name=display>
  <h3>The Display Instruction</h3>

  <p>If you check the tattoo on your left arm, you'll be reminded
  that every computer has five parts: control, datapath, memory,
  input, and output devices. Accordingly, your project must include
  an array of four seven-segment displays for output. It should
  look something like the array shown below:</p><img src=
  "display.png" />

  <p>The <tt>disp</tt> instruction assigns a register's value to
  the <tt>imm</tt>th seven-segment display. This value should be
  held until the next time a <tt>disp</tt> instruction replaces
  that display index. You may ignore or wrap immediates beyond the
  range of the display you've implemented. We've provided a
  converter library to make seven-segment displays easier to deal
  with. It can be downloaded <a href="Converter.circ">here</a> and
  included via the "Load Library/Logisim Library" menu option. See
  the examples section to get a better idea of how to incorporate
  these into your project. Any single digit hexadecimal value 0-f
  will be displayed as you'd expect. 0xff is displayed as a blank
  display (no segments highlighted). All other inputs will result
  in a '?' being displayed.</p><a name="test" id="test"></a>

<h2>Hints and Comments</h2>
This section contains hints and comments to help you get started and foster some academic debate. Feel free to skip this section for now and come back after you've gotten your hands dirty.

  <h4>Testing for Equality</h4>

  <p>It is possible to test for equality using already required ALU
  components (without adding a subtractor or comparator). Think
  about truth tables and boolean algebra.</p>

  <h4>Display Logic</h4>

  <p>You might want to make some sort of specialized register file
  for keeping track of current display values. The desired
  functionality is about halfway between a register file and a RAM
  module.</p>

  <h4>RISC vs. CISC</h4>

  <p>An in-depth discussion to come soon</p>

  <h4>Logisim's Combination Analysis Feature</h4>

  <p>Logisim offers some functionality for automating circuit
  implementation given a truth table, or vice versa. Though not
  disallowed (enforcing such a requirement is impractical), use of
  this feature is discouraged. Remember that you will not be
  allowed a laptop running Logisim on the final.</p>

  <h4>Key Differences From MIPS</h4>
  1) The zero register isn't special. $r0 is just a regular register like $r1.<br />

  2) Data memory and instruction memory are distinct. This is what we tell you in MIPS as well, but when we talk about
  caching we'll find out they still live in the same address space.<br />

<hr width=75%>

<h2>Things to Ponder</h2>

<ol>
<li>How can we swap the two registers without going to memory?
<li>What instructions act as <tt>nop</tt>s?
<li>What are the different ways of halting a program?
</ol>

<hr width=75%>

<h2>Miscellaneous Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Logisim Libraries</b> You may use any built-in logisim library circuit components in implementing your CPU.</p>

<li><b>Memory Placement</b> You must have your instruction ROM module and data RAM module
  visible from the main circuit of your Logisim project. You must
  include an array at least four seven segment displays in the main
  circuit as well. Feel free to add additional seven segment
  displays if it does not clutter your CPU.</p>

<li><b>Gated Clocks</b> Logisim allows you to send a clock through a gate. Do <font color="#ff0000"><b>NOT</b></font> do that. In real life, this is rarely done and there are always better ways to accomplish the same effect of running a clock through a gate. Any solution that uses a gated clock will be penalized heavily.</p>

<li><b>Comment your circuit.</b> Use the label tool and disconnected wires to organize your
  CPU. In particular label the control, datapath, and display
  sections.</p>

<li><b>You must use subcircuits.</b> They make it easier for you, they make it easier for us. Give your subcircuits appropriate labels as well. Keep in mind that this won't be autograded, and humans will have to look at your schematics (and grade them!)<br>
  This is actually a requirement, excessively cluttered implementations may lose some points!</p>

<li><b>USE multi-bit buses in logisim!</b> You will have to use splitters to get individual bits from the wire or to combine the bits to get a multi-bit bus! If you didn't use it for HW6, this is the time to learn how to! If you're not sure how to use these, look at <a href="../../lab/09">Lab 9</a>. If you're still confused, ask us or your peers!</p>

<li><b>USE multi-bit inputs and outputs.</b> It is difficult to debug if 
you have 16+ individual inputs scattered throughout your circuit</p>
</ul>

<hr width=75%>

  <h2>Submission</h2>
  From the directory containing cpu.circ and the files that will be specified in part 2 of this project, submit your project using the following command:

  <pre>  % submit proj3</pre>

<hr width=75%>

<!--  <h2>Extra for Experts</h2>

  <p>Once you've got your CPU up and running, give these a
  try:</p>

  <ol>
  <li> Write an assembler that can handle labels, long
  branches and jumps, and pseudo instructions. Feel free to define
  your own register and/or memory conventions to make this work
  (declare MEM[15] as assembler reserved, etc.)
  <br />
  <li> Try writing a program that divides MEM[0] by MEM[1] and stores
  the quotient in MEM[2] and the remainder in MEM[3].
  <br />
  <li> Use your program from part 2 to write a program that displays
  a location in memory as a decimal value! (be careful about jumps,
  being a linker can be tough).
  <br />
  <li> There are two R-type funct values that have not been used. Play around with these two - implement something new.
  <br />
  <li> Write something crazy that we haven't thought of.
  </ol>
